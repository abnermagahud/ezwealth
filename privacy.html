<p>This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are  concerned with how their 'Personally identifiable information' (PII) is being  used online. PII, as used in US privacy law and information security, is  information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify,  contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context.  Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we  collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable  Information in accordance with our website.</p>

<p><strong>Third party links</strong></p>
<p>Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party  products or services on our website. These third party sites have separate and  independent privacy policies.

<p><strong>Google</strong></p>
<p>Google's advertising requirements can be summed up  by Google's Advertising Principles. They are put in place to provide a positive  experience for users.  https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en&nbsp;<br />
  We have not enabled Google AdSense on our site but we may do so in the  future.</p>
<p><strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong></p>
<p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial  websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach  stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United  States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally  identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous  privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected  and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this  policy. - See more at:  http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf<br />
  <br />
  <strong>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</strong><br />
  Users can visit our site anonymously<br />
  Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our  home page, or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our  website.<br />
  Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy', and can be easily  be found on the page specified above.<br />
  <br />
  Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>•</strong>&nbsp;Via Email<br />
  Users are able to change their personal information:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>•</strong>&nbsp;By logging in to their  account<br />
  <br />
  <strong>How does our site handle do not track signals?</strong><br />
  We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use  advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?</strong><br />
  It's also important to note that we do not allow third party behavioral  tracking</p>
<p><strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to the collection of personal  information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act  (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's  consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what  operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy  and safety online.<br />
  We do not specifically market to children under 13.</p>
<p><strong>Fair Information Practices</strong></p>
<p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the  backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have  played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the  globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they  should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that  protect personal information.<br />
  <strong>In order to be in line with Fair Information  Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach  occur:</strong> <br />
  We will notify the users via email<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>•</strong>&nbsp;Within 7 business days<br />
  <br />
  We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that  individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data  collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle  requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users,  but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to  investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>
<p><strong>CAN SPAM Act</strong></p>
<p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for  commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives  recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells  out tough penalties for violations.<br />
  <strong>We collect your email address in order to:</strong> <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>•</strong>&nbsp;Send information, respond  to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.<br />
